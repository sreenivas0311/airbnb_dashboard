cleaning process was to prepare the Airbnb datasets for **accurate analysis and visualization** by handling missing values, ensuring consistency, and merging both datasets into a single structured table.  \n","\n","## **Steps Taken:**  \n","\n","### **1. Fixing Column Names**  \n","- Renamed columns where necessary to maintain **consistent naming conventions** across both datasets.  \n","- Ensured column names **do not have spaces or special characters** that might cause issues in analysis.  \n","\n","### **2. Dropping Unnecessary Columns**  \n","- Removed columns that were **not relevant to our analysis**, such as URLs, image links, and redundant calculated fields.  \n","- This helped **reduce dataset size and improve efficiency** in processing.  \n","\n","### **3. Checking & Removing Duplicates**  \n","- Verified that no duplicate records were present in both datasets.  \n","- Checked for duplicate `id` values and ensured uniqueness.  \n","\n","### **4. Converting Data Types**  \n","- Converted numerical columns like `price`, `host_acceptance_rate`, and `reviews_per_month` to **appropriate data types** (float/int).  \n","- Converted date-related fields (`host_since`, `first_review`, `last_review`) to **datetime format** for time-series analysis.  \n","- Converted boolean-like columns (`has_availability`, `host_is_superhost`) to **Boolean (True/False)** format.  \n","\n","### **5. Handling Missing Values**  \n","- **For `first_review`, `last_review`, `review_scores_value`, `reviews_per_month`:**  \n","  - These were missing for listings **with zero reviews**, so we filled them with `0` or `NaT` (for date fields).  \n","- **For `host_acceptance_rate`:**  \n","  - Found that when `host_acceptance_rate` was missing, the host was **not a superhost**, so we filled it with a lower median value.  \n","- **For `price`:**  \n","  - Imputed missing values based on **median price grouped by `neighbourhood_cleansed` and `room_type`** for better accuracy.  \n","- **For `host_neighbourhood`:**  \n","  - Filled missing values using the most frequent `neighbourhood_cleansed` value for that listing's area.  \n","- **For `has_availability`:**  \n","  - Converted missing values to **False (`f`)**, assuming no availability was reported.  \n","\n","### **6. Adding City Labels & Merging Data**  \n","- Added a **\"City\"** column to differentiate listings from **Chicago** and **New Orleans**.  \n","- Merged both datasets into a **single table** using `pd.concat()`.  \n","\n","### **7. Exporting Cleaned Data**  \n","- Exported the final cleaned dataset as `\"Cleaned_Airbnb_Data.csv\"` for **further analysis and visualizations**.  \n","\n","## **Conclusion:**  \n","This cleaning process ensures that the Airbnb dataset is **ready for accurate insights and visual storytelling**. With properly formatted data, we can now explore **trends in pricing, host behavior, and neighborhood popularity** effectively! 🚀📊  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"kh5YyStxiZCC"}}]}
